# Advent of Code

This is my repo where I post my code that calculates my solutions to problems I complete on https://adventofcode.com/.

The answers are organized into directories by year and day of the challenges.

This is a personal sandbox more than anything. So while I'm striving to write clean usable code, not everything here will be pretty or necessarily usable.

## Running
I use ts-node to run each script locally from the terminal.

- Install: `npm install -g ts-node typescript '@types/node'`
- Run script: `ts-node <path-to-file>`
- Run script without strict type checking: `ts-node --transpile-only <path-to-file>`
  - This is useful to run while writing the code to run the tests without getting stopped by type errors for in-progress code.
